        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I am Ben Greto, and I was born in Twinsburg, Ohio, but I have lived in Pennsylvania for a large majority of my life. I am currently a sophomore at University of Pittsburgh pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science.
            Growing up, I found myself enveloped in a deep curiosity and fascination of everything digital, primarily originating from an early exposure to Video Games. As I watched my physical controllers' inputs match a digitized outputs, I gazed in wonder of how this seemingly magical interaction could be possible. It wasn't until middle school, when I first tested the abstract waters of block coding through Scratch, that I began to catch a glimpse of what really goes into creating video game programs. From there, I began to experiment with coding langauges directly during my first year of highschool when a class gave me the opportunity to dabble in creative expression through HTML, CSS, and Processing. While I did not do well in the class due to the circumstances of 2020, I wasn't so easily deterred in my journey to learn more about the magic of coding; I knew it was my calling, and I still believe that to this day. Today, I find myself increasingly interested in designing applications involving multimedia (AR/VR/XR) devices, as well as the slow, yet crucial development of Brain-Computer Interfaces.

        <h2>Everyday Code</h2>
        <p>
            Code affects nearly everything we do, and therefore everything we think, as it has built the most widely used infrastructure in the world. Code can be found in nearly everything we interact with today: We find entertainment in streaming and video apps, such as HBO Max and YouTube; social interaction in social media and networking apps, such as Instagram and LinkedIn; productivity in email and workplace apps, such as Gmail and Teams. As for my personal usage of applications, data collected from my IPhone over the entirety of last week concluded that I spend an average of 13 hours every day on my phone. This seems like an absurd amount, as it would mean that I would have to have my phone open for all waking hours of the day. Though in actuality, it is quite the opposite; A majority of my app usage occurs during the night. Many times I enjoy falling asleep to some form of noise, and for me that is almost always a YouTube video. This is likely why YouTube makes up 42% of my total phone usage. I also find myself on Instagram very often to scroll through Reels and send messages to friends and family.

    <div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
        <h2>Code and digital technology impact on education</h2>
        <p>Computer Science has entirely revolutionized modes of expression, and has led to a great distribution of wealth and knowledge across the globe ever since the World Wide Web was established. With the development of new coding langauges came exciting new outlets to express, design, and publish ideas in widely distributed digital environments. Through a more modern lens, these developments in coding have brought a polarizing, yet resourceful inlet of ideas to the world of composition: Artificial Intelligence in the form of Large Language Models (LLMs). These LLMs provide streams of information and ideas at the beck and call of users. This has led to a contentious rise in usage among many students and professors alike within a multitude of departments, with most contention likely arising from that of English departments. Due to the prediction-based nature of LLMs, many find that there is a degredation in the quality of information, as well as severe instances of plagiarism, in AI-produced texts; However, many others may find that LLM-produced texts improve the efficiency of composition, without noticing much of either of the aforementioned issues. With such differing positions, it is important to host and contribute to much discourse surrounding these products so that we may forge a path forward, whether it be a path of immutability, or a path of adaptation.</p>

            Code and technology are going to be the backbone of my career, as I plan on completing my degree in CS with a minor in IS. To become a designer of code, instead of just one of its users, is my dream. Within this course, I am mostly interested in learning more about website composition from a coding standpoint, so I hope that this course will delve a bit further into more complex HTML/CSS projects. Additionally, I am excited to learn more about different Adobe composition softwares, as I am unfamiliar with that category of software. Outside of this classroom, I will hone my coding skills through my other classes, as well as a few personal projects or research that I may take part in.
